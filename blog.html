                            Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one

                            Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The
                            Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the
